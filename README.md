# MQT DDVis - An installation-free web-tool for visualizing quantum decision diagrams

MQT DDVis is an installation-free web-tool that visualizes quantum decision diagrams and allows to explore their behavior when used in design tasks such as simulation, synthesis, or verification.
MQT DDVis is hosted at [https://www.cda.cit.tum.de/app/ddvis/](https://www.cda.cit.tum.de/app/ddvis/).
It is part of the [_Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT)_](https://mqt.readthedocs.io).

## Key Features

MQT DDVis allows users to interactively learn how decision diagrams can be used in quantum computing, e.g., to

- compactly represent quantum states and efficiently simulate quantum circuits,
- compactly represent the functionality of quantum circuits, and
- verify the equivalence of two circuits in an efficient fashion.

If you have any questions, feel free to create a [discussion](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/ddvis/discussions) or an [issue](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/ddvis/issues) on [GitHub](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/ddvis).

## Contributors and Supporters

The _[Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT)](https://mqt.readthedocs.io)_ is developed by the [Chair for Design Automation](https://www.cda.cit.tum.de/) at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/) and supported by the [Munich Quantum Software Company (MQSC)](https://munichquantum.software).
Among others, it is part of the [Munich Quantum Software Stack (MQSS)](https://www.munich-quantum-valley.de/research/research-areas/mqss) ecosystem, which is being developed as part of the [Munich Quantum Valley (MQV)](https://www.munich-quantum-valley.de) initiative.

## Getting Started

The following commands will build the app and start it.
Open your browser at `localhost:3000` to access the user interface.

```console
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:munich-quantum-toolkit/ddvis.git mqt-ddvis
cd mqt-ddvis
npm install
npm run-script build
npm run-script run
[...]
> node ./bin/www
```

## System Requirements

To run DDVis locally, you will require a C++ compiler with support for C++17, CMake, Node.js, and NPM.

## Cite This
